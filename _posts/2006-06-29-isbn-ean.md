# How to convert ean bar code to ISBN 10

Here is how to convert EAN to readable and useful ISBN 10 code.

1. remove the first 3 digit 978 that represents books, remove the last digit which is a check number, you have now a 9 digits code which represent the isbn but you will need the checksum digit to be complete 
2. to do the checksum: take every digit of this uncomplete isbn code and mulitply every one by is oder (the first by 1, the second by 2, … the last one by 9)
3. sum all the results together
4. calculate the modulo modulus (thanks Ian) 11 of the sum to obtain the checksum digit
5. You have the checksum digit

Now put this digit on the right of the 9 others and you obtain the ISBN 10 code.
