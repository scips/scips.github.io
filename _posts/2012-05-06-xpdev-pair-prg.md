# XPdev hot seat at work experience learned

I proposed new objectives to myself:
Programming in XP (hot seat: 2 dev one computer) 1/2 day per week with another developer each week.
Here is a summary of DOs and DONTs to keep in mind.

Let’s say there are 2 guys:

**Tori**: the executor (the guy who have the keyboard and explain what he does)
**Uke**: the learner (the guy who look at the guy who have the keyboard and learn from what he does)

|| DO 	|| DON’T ||

Explain the whole concept of XP hot seat, Tori & Uke roles and plan it 	Start without briefing, scheduled appointment
Predefine the scope 1 day before 	start without plan
Master the concept of the scope 	do a spike in XP as it request a lot of documentation reading
Read the documentation the day before 	Drive blind
Use shortcuts, quick links, snippets, auto completion, syntax highlighting 	Use notepad or similar way of development
Refine and reduce objective and scope while working 	Enlarge the scope and work on more and more stuff
Let Tori explain what he is doing 	Let Uke take the lead
Respect the time window of 15 minutes 	Let Tori continue over 15 minutes
Stop and re-schedule, redefine scope when it fails (both get stuck by a lack of knowledge for instance) 	Continue if it doesn’t work
